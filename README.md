# Fractal compression

In this repository I play around with implementing the fractal compression algorithm in different languages.

## Resources

- [Wikipedia article on fractal compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_compression)

- [Blog post by Mike James, 2022](https://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/482-fractal-image-compression.html) This is my favourite resource, it explains the algorithm in a very clear way. Beginner friendly.

- [Blog post by pierre, 2018](https://pvigier.github.io/2018/05/14/fractal-image-compression.html) Apart from the explanation it also includes a python implementation.
